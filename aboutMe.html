                <p id="infoA">Hello, my name is Wendy Consuegra. I am currently a junior at Queens Technical High School. I would like to inspire people and make a change in this world. I value hardwork, imagination, and the idea that anything is possible. At the moment I am trying to figure out what i want to pursue while participating in many activities which consist of learning code in codenation, programming a robot in robotics, and a few more that follow.</p>
